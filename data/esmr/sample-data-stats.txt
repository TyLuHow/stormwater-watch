Additional Data Analysis Statistics
====================================

Sample Size: 9,999 records from 2025 eSMR dataset
File Size: 10,000 lines (header + 9,999 data rows)
Download Date: November 29, 2025

Column Count: 29 columns
Required Fields: 15 (0% null)
Optional Fields: 14 (varying null rates)

Top Facilities in Sample:
- EBMUD SD#1-Wet Wthr Bypass (facility_place_id: 222130)
- Burbank WRP (facility_place_id: 212135)
- Whittier Narrows Water Reclamation Plant (facility_place_id: 235826)
- El Portal WWTF (facility_place_id: 222491)
- Delta Diablo WWTP (facility_place_id: 219552)

Top Parameters in Sample:
- Flow (highly frequent)
- Total Coliform
- pH
- Chlorine, Total Residual
- Chloride

Date Range in Sample:
- From: 2025-02-01
- To: 2025-02-14 (and later dates)
- Coverage: Primarily February 2025 data

Regions Represented:
- Region 2 - San Francisco Bay
- Region 3 - Central Coast
- Region 4 - Los Angeles
- Region 5F - Fresno
- Region 9 - San Diego

Location Types:
- Effluent Monitoring (most common)
- Influent Monitoring
- Receiving Water Monitoring
- Recycled Water Monitoring
- Internal Monitoring

Qualifiers Distribution:
- "=" (Detected): Most common
- "<" (Less than detection)
- "ND" (Not Detected)
- "DNQ" (Detected Not Quantified)

Data Quality Observations:
1. BOM character in CSV header (UTF-8 byte order mark)
2. "NaN" used for null numeric values
3. "NA" used for null string values
4. Empty strings also used for nulls in some fields
5. Coordinates 86.6% null (likely only for receiving water locations)
6. Analytical method 59.7% null (not required for all measurements)
7. QA codes essentially unused (100% null in sample)

Performance Implications:
- Fact table (esmr_samples) will be largest by far
- 9,999 samples from 8 facilities = avg 1,249 samples per facility
- Extrapolating to thousands of facilities = millions of samples statewide
- Need partitioning, strategic indexing, and batch import strategy
